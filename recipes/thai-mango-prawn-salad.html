    <h1>Thai Mango, Prawn and Avocado Salad</h1>
      <img src="../recipes/images/thai-mango-prawn-avocado-salad.jpg" width="300" height="300">
    <h1>About the recipe!</h1>  
      <p>The absolute perfect meal for a stinking hot day. It was light, fresh,<br> easy to make, zero 
        cooking required (unless you count soaking noodles<br> in boiling water as cooking) and just downright
        delicious. The trusty Prawn<br> is one of my favourite seafoods and paired with mango, avocado and a zesty<br>
        lime and coconut dressing, it was literally Summer on a plate.
      </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
          <li>Peeled fresh cooked prawns, the quantity is up to you</li>

          <li>1 mango, cheeks cut off, skin removed and sliced thinly</li>
          
          <li>250gm of rice stick noodles (I use Chang’s Pad Thai brand)</li>
          
          <li>150gm of snow peas, top removed and sliced diagonally</li>
          
          <li>1 lebanese cucumber, halved lengthways, deseeded and sliced diagonally</li>
          
          <li>Two handfuls of bean sprouts</li>

          <li>1 ripe but firm Avocado, halved skin removed and sliced thinly</li>

          <li>1 cup of coriander leaves</li>
          
          <li>1/2 a cup of mint leaves</li>
          
          <li>1/2 a red onion, sliced very finely, top to bottom/li>
          
          <li>1 red chilli, finely sliced diagonally (seeds removed if you prefer)</li>
          
          <li>1 maraschino cherry for garnish</li>

          <li>1/2 cup of toasted granulated peanuts</li>
          
          <li>Lime wedges to serve</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Dressing</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>1 cup of coconut milk</li>

        <li>1 tbs of rice wine vinegar</li>
        
        <li>2 tbs of fish sauce</li>
        
        <li>1 heaped tbs of brown sugar</li>
        
        <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Place the noodles in a large, heat proof bowl and pour over boiling water.<br> 
              Allow to soak for 10 – 12 minutes or until tender before draining and rinsing<br>
              well under cold water.</li>
          <li>To make the dressing, whisk all of the ingredients together until the sugar has<br>
              dissolved. Have a taste and adjust if necessary, you should have the perfect balance<br>
              of sweet, salty and sour.</li>
          <li>Place the snow peas in a small bowl and cover with boiling water for two minutes until<br>
              bright green. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
          <li>Place the noodles and snow peas back in the large bowl along with the bean shoots, cucumber<br>
              and mango slices. Pour over half of the dressing and toss gently to combine. Divide the noodle<br>
              mixture between four serving bowls and place the prawns on top in a lovely pile.</li>
          <li>Toss the coriander, mint and red onion together with your fingers and pile on top of the prawns.<br>
              Fan the avocado out gently with your fingers and place it to the side of the bowl.</li>
          <li>Drizzle over the remaining dressing and top with a smattering of peanuts and the chilli slices.<br>
              Serve with lime wedges and enjoy with a lovely glass of Pinot Gris.</li>
        </ol>
